| OWASP Item | Description | Example | When | Solution |
| --- |  --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Injection | Anyone who can send untrusted data to the system. Often found in SQL, noSQL, LDAP, XPath, XML parses, SMTP headers, Expression language, ORM queries | Data inputed by user is not validate, filtered or sanitized | string query=" SELECT* FROM accounts where ID={request.Parameters[RequestParameter.ID]}". Usage of vulnerable frameworks or library | Apply Static source (SAST) or Dynamic application test (DAST) into CI/CD pipeline. Use safe API, avoid interpreters, parameterize ex: query WHERE id=?. Escape special characters. Use limit in command query |
| Broken Authentication | Attacker has access to hundreds of username, password using automated brute force, dictionary attack tools. | use a list of well-known passwords: 123456, admin/admin. Use pw as a sole factor and with strict password policy encouraging users to use and reuse weak passwords. Session timeout are not set | Uses plain text or weakly hashed passwords. Miss 2FA, Exposes session IDs in the URL, not validate session periodly. | Implement weak password check. NIST 800-63B guidlines in section 5.1.1 for memorized secrets. Limit failed login.  |
| Sensitive Data Explosure | PII, PHI, credit card, business secrets is considered as sensitive data. GDPR, Financial data protection. | Automatic db encryption will decrypt automatically when retrieved. Use http. Password uses unsalted or simple hashes. | Not encrypting sensitive data | Use TLS, verify useragent if the received server certifidate is valid. Don't store sensitive data unnecessarily. use strong encrhypt algorithm. Enforce HSTS |
| XML External Entities | hacker include hostile information into xml (SOAP, SAML) | Attackers extract data from xml file of SOAP, change some data in xml. Include endless file in XML  | The application accepts XML upload from untrusted source| OWASP XXE prevention. Avoid serialization of sensitive data. Use SOAP 1.2 or higher. Disable XML external entity and DTD processing. Implement server side input validation. Use XSD validation to verify xml or xsl. SAST tools to detect XXE in source code. |
| Broken Access Control | Bypassing access control checks. view or edit someone else's account. Acting as admin when loging as a user. | Attacker modify the userid in browser to see other user information. If nonadmin can access admin page, it's a flaw | misconfig CORS. | Deny by default. CORS. Enforce record ownership. Disable webserver directory listing. Log access control failures. JWT should be invalidate on server after logout. |
| Security Misconfiguration | Use of default admin account/configuration. | Directory listing is enable. Show detail stack traces/ errors.  | Unnecessary features are enabled(ports, services, pages). Using default account. Security is disabled on upgrading. Software is vulnerable | Automate the environmental deployment. Use Minimal platform without samples, unnecessary features. Review & update configuration. Segmented application architecture. Automate process to verify all environments. |
| Cross Site scripting | Run script on user's browser, Key logging.  ||| Use framework that escapes XSS by design. OWASP XSS prevention, DOM based XSS prevention. Enable Content Security Policy. |
| Insecure Deserialization |  | pass Serialized user information forth and back between each request.  || Implement digital signatures on serialized object. Login exception while serialize/ deserialize. Monitor deserialization which happen constantly. |
| Using Components with known vulnerabilities |  ||| Subscribe email for security vulnerabilities related to components. Obtain components from official sources. Monitor libraries or components |
| Insifficient Logging and Monitoring | It takes a lot of time to identify and fix a breach without monitoring tools & log | Log logins, failed login, high value transactions || Log access control failures, failed input validation |
